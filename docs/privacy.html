      <p><i>Updated January 18th, 2021</i></p>
      <p>When you launch the TurboWarp Desktop app, it may make a request to desktop.turbowarp.org to check for updates. We do not log these requests. This is an important security feature that can not be turned off. It will never automatically update -- it is always up to the user to decide.</p>
      <p>That's it.</p>
